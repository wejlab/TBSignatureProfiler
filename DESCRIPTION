Description: Gene signatures of TB progression, TB disease, and other TB disease
    states have been validated and published previously. This package aggregates
    known signatures and provides computational tools to enlist their usage on
    other datasets. The TBSignatureProfiler makes it easy to profile RNA-Seq
    data using these signatures and includes common signature profiling tools
    including ASSIGN, GSVA, and ssGSEA.
